<p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
The motivation behind the development of a human-in-the-loop (HiL) driving simulator is to create a platform that allows for the collection of naturalistic driving data in a controlled environment. This is crucial for advancing the research and development of personalized motion control systems that consider individual driving styles and their impact on energy consumption, especially in the context of automated eco-driving. The significance of such a simulator lies in its ability to replicate realistic driving scenarios without the limitations and risks associated with real-world data collection, such as uncontrollable environmental factors and safety concerns. The HiL simulator enables researchers to gather comprehensive data across various driving conditions, which is essential for improving driver behavior modeling, enhancing the efficiency of autonomous driving systems, and ultimately contributing to safer and more sustainable transportation solutions.

<p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;"><b><i> Role of the Human-in-the-Loop Driving Simulator: </i></b> The human-in-the-loop driving simulator integrates various hardware components, such as a steering wheel, pedals, shifter, and cockpit, with advanced software like <b><i>CARLA</b></i>, an open-source autonomous driving simulator, or <b><i>CarSim</b></i>. This setup, as shown above, allows a human driver to interact with the simulation environment, providing real-time feedback on driving behaviors. The role of the simulator is to bridge the gap between human driving inputs and the response of autonomous driving systems, enabling the collection of detailed data on how different driving styles influence vehicle dynamics and energy consumption. By involving a human driver in the loop, the simulator can capture the nuances of natural driving behaviors, which are essential for developing more accurate and personalized motion control algorithms for energy-efficient driving. </p>
<p>The leveraged software with the Driving Simulator mainly includes:<br>
1. <u><i><b>CarSim</b></i></u>: Precise Vehicle Dynamics Simulation <br>
2. <u><i><b>CarLa</b></i></u>: Realistic Human-Machine Interaction Interface <br>
3. <u><i><b>SUMO</b></i></u>: Flexible Traffic Flow Simulation <br>
4. <u><i><b>ROS</b></i></u>: Comprehensive Communication Interfaces <br>
